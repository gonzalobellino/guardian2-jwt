## Code sample using go-guardian v2 in combination with JWT

## Description
    
This code has been base from this good article published in [medium.com](https://medium.com/@hajsanad/writing-scalable-authentication-in-golang-using-go-guardian-83691219a73a) about the usage of go-guardian. With a little bit of changes I put a piece of flavor just for fun:

- Migration to go guard v2
- A refactor of the code using negroni
- Including a sample Cors handler
